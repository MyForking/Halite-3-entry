# Halite-3-entry

This is my entry for the Halite 3 competition, it ended up reaching second place in the finals.

Disclaimer: This code is optimized for the game first, performance second, programming speed third. It's not at all optimized for readability or maintainability, so it'll be hard to read and probably impossible to comprehend.

There's some information about the structure of my bot, and about my approach in the comments inside.

Acknowledgements:

Thanks to the Two Sigma, the Halite devs and Janzert for the fun and well-run competition. And thanks to the players Fohristiwhirl and Mlomb for the extremely useful tools they've made, I owe a lot of my success to them. Also, I'd like to thank all those active on discord for making the competition a lot more enjoyable and for all the interesting discussions we've had (many of which have been useful)
